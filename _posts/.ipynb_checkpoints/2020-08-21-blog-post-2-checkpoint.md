On Thursday morning we began the second phase of the SR2007 cruise journey, eagerly checking out of our rooms and emerging into the freedom of open space. We gathered ourselves onto the bus and navigated to Nimitz Maritime Facility-known as MarFac (short for Maritime Facility), where the Scripps vessels are held. I was in the first bus and upon arrival we unloaded our personal belongings and the small amount of gear that the principal investigators (PIs) brought with them. 
We were then introduced to Captain Ian and the chief mate Cameron, who briefed us on the safety and regulations. Despite out 6-day quarantine and 3 negative tests, there are strict mask and social distance policies enforced on the ship. Everyone is to wear a mask unless eating, drinking, sleeping or in their rooms. We must take temperatures twice daily and the ship is constantly sanitized by the crew. 

As the next bus arrived and the others got their orientation, we loaded onto the Sally Ride, which loomed out of the bay like a starship from a space sci-fi movie, adorned with cranes, and all sorts of machinery and modular features to accommodate a variety of oceanographic research demands.

I am rooming with a graduate student named Allison, who is currently pursuing her PhD at UC Santa Cruz, with one of the PIs on the cruise, Dr. Phoebe Lam, a chemical oceanographer. Their team will be using instruments called McClane pumps, alongside CTDs (conductivity-temperature, and depth-one of the most universally used oceanographic instruments) to examine the physical-chemical properties of the water column at our research stations.

Our room is small, and I will be sleeping on the top bunk. Allison and I are part of different cohorts (she is in Phoebe’s team and I will be with my advisor, Moira working on the 1m2 MOCNESS so we will have to be considerate of each other’s sleep schedules as we enter extremely variable days in the coming weeks. 

We spent the remainder of the day loading the ship and setting up lab spaces. I learned a great deal about machinery and tools, which was a nice change from the less hands-on work I have been doing in data analysis. I worked to secure gear and tables with ratchet straps and bungee cords to prevent items from sliding or falling as we roll across the waves. 

I also had a chance to meet the crew and explore the ship, quickly finding the gym and exercise spaces to appease my addiction to physical activity. There is a gym in the very bottom of the ship, hidden through a hole and down a ladder. The gym has fairly nice weights and equipment, including a spin bike and bench. A separate room (more like a closet) also has a treadmill, rowing machine and stair climber, where I will probably be spending a great deal of time. I even had the chance to indulge in my first “run” since before Humphreys and moving the legs felt freeing.

On the main floor of the ship lie the labs, the main deck, and the galley. The lab spaces are quite large and accompanied by numerous monitors that display the ocean conditions as well as the ships trajectory and orientation. The galley is stocked with great snacks and the cooks are friendly and accommodating to dietary restrictions. With social distancing in place we have signed up for designated meal slots and all tables are labeled with a seating capacity. Many of us have chosen to eat outside in the fresh air, with a beautiful view of the ocean and ability to chat more freely.

After a restful night of sleep lulled by the gentle tide of the bay, Friday followed a similar flow, setting up lab spaces and prepping, with short breaks to eat. At the end of both workdays we were offered the chance to swim in the bay, which I gladly took advantage of. The water was warm and refreshing compared to my home of Bodega Bay in northern California, though I was one of the few who went for the dip. The crew also held a small social gathering on the pier, within the confines of the orange tape that marked the boundary that fenced us in. Their first time on land in weeks and one of the few chances to indulge in some less-restricted fun allowed us all to engage in some enjoyable beverages, conversation, and an intense game of Jenga.

At the conclusion of time in port we checked in for the night for an early morning departure, the air filled with anticipation, nerves for the uncertainties ahead, and excitement for the opportunity to escape to the sea.
