This is an NSF-funded cruise led by Anela Choy to investigate the vertical structure of plankton, micronekton and particles across environmental gradients off the California Coast. The cruise is a collaboration between 4 separate labs-the Choy and Decima labs at Scripps, the Lam lab at UCSC, and the Taniguchi lab at CSUSM.

This will be my first research cruise and my first time ever at sea! While this whole experience will be new for me, the precruise protocols will be a trial for all. Due to COVID the preparation for Scripps cruises now involves a multi-test and quarantine procedure that begins 2 weeks before we even board the ship. I will be documenting the entire process from COVID precautions to sailing and eventually disembarking.

Enjoy following along for the voyage!
