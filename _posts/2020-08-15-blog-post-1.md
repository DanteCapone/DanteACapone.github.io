#### Part 1: Testing and Arrival to Humphrey's Half Moon Inn
The journey for this cruise begins with an extended period of isolation on land in the generous accomodations of Humphrey's Halfmoon Inn on Shelter Island in San Diego, CA. Due to the global pandemic of COVID-19, the process of getting everyone safely aboard the RV Sally Ride and out to sea has become slightly more complicated. To ensure that the virus does not make its way onto the ship, all participants in Scripps cruises are required to undergo a series of tests and practice isolation prior to departure.

First, we were all initially tested for COVID on August 6th. I chose to get this test in San Diego, moving down the day before to relocate before begining my PhD at Scripps in the Fall. This was my first time getting tested and it was more than mildly uncomfortable. Between getting a shot and having my nose swabbed I'm not sure which I would pick, however with a COVID test, the length of discomfort is within the hands of the test-administrator, so if they are in a bad mood you might be out of luck.

After this first test we all buckled down for shelter-in-place in our respective homes, only leaving for essential activities such as grocery shopping or exercise. On August 14th we returned to the testing facility to get another COVID test, after which we drove directly to Humphrey's Half Moon Inn on Shelter Island where we would remain until the cruise. This meant that we had to bring everything we would need to maintain sanity during isolation, as well as all of our cruise gear. This being my first cruise I felt that it was better to overpack, so I brought nearly my entire wardrobe, as well as various items to entertain myself in the hotel room: art supplies, a massage gun, and my ellitpical bicycle with an indoor trainer. At the recommendation of previous cruise participants I also brought my own coffee and filters and my favorite snacks-mostly nut butters.

While we were staying at Humphrey's we are not to leave our rooms for any reason, else we risk exposure to the virus. This means that each day we fill out an order form for the three meals we would like delivered outside of our door for the day. The menu is decadent but limited, though the kitchen staff is accomodating to specific requests or substitutions (which is essential when you are a picky vegetarain like myself).

Despite confinement, life in the hotel room is extremely comfortable and with a refreshing patio view we are able to take a step outside to converse across the fence to our neighbors. The patio looks directly onto the bay where we can observe ships pass by the naval station or joggers and cyclists whizz make their way across out lookout. I have enjoyed several lengthy conversations with other Scripps quarantiners. My neighbors include two undergraduates-Rachel and Sierra, as well as three other graduate students-Tiffany, Shailja and Olivia. 

To stay connected some of the students have also met through Zoom for a game night led by Julie, a second year PhD student in Anela's lab as well as a yoga session, led by me. Despite physical isolation, I feel as though I've been able to connect more with people in the past few days!


#### Part 2: Clear of COVID, but Contracting Cabin Fever...

On Tuesday, August 18th we met in the parking lot of Humphrey's at 7:30 AM to board charter buses to our final COVID test at the same testing site. It was our first time leaving the small space of the hotel room since Friday and I felt an odd freedom of movement. I joyfully ran to the bus, not because I was late, but simply to move through a space that was not room 104 of Humphrey's. Aboard the bus we sat as distanced as possible with masks and I quickly learned the difficulty of communication through masks, something we will all need to adapt to aboard the <i> RV Sally Ride </i>. I never realized how much watching the movement of one's lips helps in understanding their words. When in a noisy environment such as a bus or ship, it might be beneficial to adopt some hand or body signals.

We faced some slight obstacles when entering the parking lot where the tests were conducted. There was a long line of cars into the lot, which made it difficult for the bus to maneuver in. On top of this, arriving cars persistently tried to cut us off in line, which made us early risers even more irritable. We all agreed that maybe the comfort of our simple hotel room existences wasn't so bad.

Finally, the bus pulled into the lot and we all hung around outside in the sun light while we waited for the go-ahead to walk into the testing site. One by one we lined up and made our way in for the third and final test. At this point I anticipated the discomfort of the test entering my nostril, but it still caused my eyes to water.
