The journey for this cruise begins with an extended period of isolation on land in the generous accomodations of Humphrey's Halfmoon Inn on Shelter Island in San Diego, CA. Due to the global pandemic of COVID-19, the process of getting everyone safely aboard the RV Sally Ride and out to sea has become slightly more complicated. To ensure that the virus does not make its way onto the ship, all participants in Scripps cruises are required to undergo a series of tests and practice isolation prior to departure.

First, we were all initially tested for COVID on August 6th. I chose to get this test in San Diego, moving down the day before to relocate before begining my PhD at Scripps in the Fall. This was my first time getting tested and it was more than mildly uncomfortable. Between getting a shot and having my nose swabbed I'm not sure which I would pick, however with a COVID test, the length of discomfort is within the hands of the test-administrator, so if they are in a bad mood you might be out of luck.

After this first test we all buckled down for shelter-in-place in our respective homes, only leaving for essential activities such as grocery shopping or exercise. On August 14th we returned to the testing facility to get another COVID test, after which we drove directly to Humphrey's Half Moon Inn on Shelter Island where we would remain until the cruise. This meant that we needed to bring everything we would need to maintain sanity during isolation, as well as all of our cruise gear. This being my first cruise I felt that it was better to overpack, so I brought nearly my entire wardrobe, as well as various paraphenalia to entertain myself in the hotel room: art supplies, a massage gun, and my ellitpical bicycle with an indoor trainer. I also maintain a fairly specific diet, so I brought an abundance of snacks, including an excessive amount of nut butter.

While we were staying at Humphrey's we are not to leave our rooms for any reason, else we risk exposure to the virus. This means that each day we fill out an order form for the three meals we would like delivered outside of our door for the day. Despite confinement, life in the hotel room is extremely comfortable and with a refreshing patio view we are able to take a step outside to converse across the fence to our neighbors.
