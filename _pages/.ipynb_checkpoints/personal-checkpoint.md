## Creative Exploits

Alongside my more left-brained interests in science and my physical interests in sports and recreation, I also seek to maintain and develop my creativity through art, crafts, and play.

### Sourdough Bread Making

Following the cultural trend that occurred during the initiation of the COVID-19 quarantine I began to bake sourdough bread thanks to a starter I recieved from my colleague. I became enthralled with the process of perfecting an aesthetic loaf and have now made several dozen loaves. I sought to master the plain dourdough before moving on to added ingredients and toppings, but even with my experience I am constantly learning and adjusting my recipes and methods. 



### Art
