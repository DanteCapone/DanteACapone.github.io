I am a passionate, dedicated, semi-neurotic, competitive distance runner who enjoys using exercise to connect with new communities and places. Running provides me with a physical, mental, and social outlet and is an area of life which I can strive for objective goals. After running competitively since middle school, moving to Analy high school and fully embracing the sport as an NCAA athlete at UC Santa Cruz, I continue to train at a high level. I am currently pursuing PRs in the shorter events (1500m-5000m) before moving on to longer road races and eventually marathons.
